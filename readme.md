Discover music through Twitter conversaions
Just put in a twitter user name and it does the rest

## What?

This was a hack created by @mfong and @adibbehjat
during SF Music Hack Day 2013


This is PHP in the back and JS in the front to
communicate with Twitter and SoudndCloud's APIs.

The hack searches for the first soundcloud link
of the desired user and then searches that user's
mention's tweets for the next SoundCloud link
to play music seamlessly.
